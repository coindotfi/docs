# CoinFi AAMM

Explore the cutting-edge CoinFi Automated Atomic Market Maker (AAMM) to discover market trends, analyze real-time asset data, and stay informed about the latest innovations in decentralized market making.

CoinFi leverages its Layer 1 AppChain to provide a seamless and secure environment for users to trade and manage their assets. We provide users the ability to have
Atomic Swaps over diversified liquidity pools, and we provide liquidity providers the ability to earn fees from their liquidity provisions.

## Atomic Swaps

Atomic Swaps are a type of decentralized exchange (DEX) that allow users to trade assets without the need for a trusted third party. Instead, the assets are traded directly between two parties, without the need for intermediaries.

In the case of CoinFi, the two parties are the user and the liquidity provider. The user initiates the swap by sending a transaction to the AppChain, which then matches the swap with a liquidity pool. The liquidity provider then provides liquidity to the pool, and the user receives the asset they wanted to trade.

## Liquidity Pools

Liquidity pools are a type of decentralized exchange (DEX) that allow users to trade assets without the need for a trusted third party. Instead, the assets are traded directly between two parties, without the need for intermediaries.

In the case of CoinFi, the two parties are the user and the liquidity provider. The user initiates the swap by sending a transaction to the AppChain, which then matches the swap with a liquidity pool. The liquidity provider then provides liquidity to the pool, and the user receives the asset they wanted to trade.
