<Note>
  Welcome to the CoinFi API documentation. This guide provides a comprehensive reference for interacting with our secure, quantum-safe blockchain platform. Whether you're developing decentralized applications, managing digital assets, or working with smart contracts via our SDK, you'll find everything you need here.
</Note>

## Overview

The CoinFi API empowers developers to harness our cutting-edge blockchain technology underpinned by quantum-safe security measures. With endpoints for real-time blockchain data retrieval, transaction management, and smart contract interactions, you can build robust, next-generation financial applications with ease.

### Key Features
- **Quantum-Safe Security:** Protect your digital assets with industry-leading post-quantum encryption.
- **Real-Time Blockchain Data:** Access up-to-date status information, transaction histories, and network metrics.
- **SDK Integration:** Accelerate development with our multi-language SDK supporting JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Rust, and Golang.
- **Smart Contract Interactions:** Facilitate seamless on-chain operations via advanced transaction and contract endpoints.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are secured with Bearer token authentication. Include your API token in the request header as shown below:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

The following security scheme is used throughout the API:

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```

You can obtain your API token from the [CoinFi Developer Dashboard [COMING SOON!]](#).

## API Endpoints

### 1. Blockchain Status

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/status`

Retrieve essential information about the CoinFi blockchain, including the latest block height, timestamp, and node health.

**Request Headers:**
- `Authorization`: Bearer token

**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "blockHeight": 987654,
  "timestamp": "2023-10-15T12:34:56Z",
  "nodeStatus": "Healthy",
  "networkLoad": "Moderate"
}
```

### 2. Transaction History

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/transactions`

Fetch a list of recent blockchain transactions. You can filter transactions by block range, participant address, or transaction type.

**Query Parameters:**
- `limit` *(integer)*: Maximum number of transactions to retrieve (default: 25).
- `startBlock` *(integer)*: Starting block number.
- `endBlock` *(integer)*: Ending block number.
- `address` *(string)*: Blockchain address (either sender or receiver).

**Example Request:**

```http
GET /api/v1/transactions?limit=50&startBlock=980000&endBlock=987654&address=0xABC123 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "transactions": [
    {
      "txHash": "0xabcde12345",
      "from": "0x1234abcd",
      "to": "0xabcd1234",
      "amount": "250.00",
      "timestamp": "2023-10-15T12:30:00Z"
    }
    // additional transactions...
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "limit": 50,
    "offset": 0,
    "total": 1024
  }
}
```

### 3. Submit Transaction

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/transactions`

Broadcast a new transaction to the CoinFi blockchain. This endpoint accepts transaction details and queues the transaction for network processing.

**Request Headers:**
- `Content-Type`: application/json
- `Authorization`: Bearer token

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "from": "0x1234abcd",
  "to": "0xabcd1234",
  "amount": "100.00",
  "nonce": 15,
  "signature": "generated_signature_from_sdk"
}
```

**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "txHash": "0xnewtx7890",
  "status": "submitted",
  "message": "Transaction has been successfully submitted to the blockchain."
}
```

## SDK Integration

CoinFi provides a robust SDK to streamline blockchain interactions. Our SDK automates key management, transaction signing, and quantum-safe encryption, enabling you to focus on building innovative applications.

Explore our SDK documentation for detailed guides and sample code:
- **[JavaScript/TypeScript SDK](arpc/arpc-development/sdk/arpc-javascript.mdx)**
- **[Python SDK](arpc/arpc-development/sdk/arpc-python.mdx)**
- **[Rust SDK](arpc/arpc-development/sdk/arpc-rust.mdx)**
- **[Golang SDK](arpc/arpc-development/sdk/arpc-golang.mdx)**

Leverage these tools to quickly integrate secure blockchain operations into your projects.

## Error Handling

The CoinFi API returns standard HTTP status codes along with informative error messages. Common error codes include:
- **400 Bad Request:** Invalid input or missing parameters.
- **401 Unauthorized:** Invalid or expired API token.
- **403 Forbidden:** Insufficient permissions.
- **404 Not Found:** The requested resource does not exist.
- **429 Too Many Requests:** Rate limit exceeded.
- **500 Internal Server Error:** Server encountered an error.

These responses aid in diagnosing issues and improving application resilience.

## Rate Limiting

To ensure consistent performance and fair usage, the API enforces rate limits. Exceeding these limits will result in a `429 Too Many Requests` response. For optimal performance, consult the rate limit guidelines on the [CoinFi Developer Portal [COMING SOON!]](#).

## Getting Started

Kickstart your integration with the CoinFi API by following these steps:

1. **Register:** Obtain your API key via the [CoinFi Developer Dashboard [COMING SOON]](#).
2. **Explore:** Use our interactive API explorer to test endpoints and familiarize yourself with our data structure.
3. **Integrate:** Utilize our multi-language SDK to reduce boilerplate and enhance security.
4. **Develop:** Follow our comprehensive [Developer Guides](coin-chain-builders/coinfi-build/coinfi-introduction/chain-introduction.mdx) for best practices and advanced workflows.
