# CoinFi Blockchain RPC Documentation

Welcome to the **CoinFi Blockchain RPC Documentation**. This expert-level guide provides a comprehensive list of `curl` commands and examples to interact directly with our Cosmos-based CoinFi network. You can use these examples when:

- Querying blockchain state (e.g., retrieving block info or consensus state)
- Broadcasting new transactions
- Monitoring network health and validator status

> **Note:**  
> - Many endpoints (such as transaction broadcasting) are compatible with both GET (via query parameters) and POST (with a JSON payload).  
> - Replace placeholder values (e.g., `<HEIGHT>`, `<TX_DATA>`, `<QUERY>`) with your actual values.  
> - Ensure you use the correct endpoint (`https://api.coinfi.zone`) and a valid API token in production.

## Example REST API Requests

### 1. Get Transactions
Retrieve the latest 10 transactions:
```sh
curl -X GET "https://api.coinfi.zone/transactions?limit=10" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

### 2. Submit a Transaction
Submit a new transaction using a JSON payload:
```sh
curl -X POST "https://api.coinfi.zone/transactions" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "from": "sender_address",
  "to": "receiver_address",
  "amount": "50",
  "nonce": 123456,
  "signature": "signature_string"
}'
```

### 3. Cancel a Pending Transaction
Cancel a transaction by its ID:
```sh
curl -X DELETE "https://api.coinfi.zone/transactions/12345" -H "Accept: application/json"
```

## RPC Endpoints Overview

In addition to the above REST API endpoints, CoinFi provides a full suite of RPC endpoints for direct low-level interaction with the blockchain. These include:

- **ABCI Endpoints:** For application-specific queries.
- **Block & Header Endpoints:** Retrieve block or header data by height, hash, or search query.
- **Consensus & Genesis Endpoints:** Access consensus state and genesis block information.
- **Transaction & Broadcast Endpoints:** Check transaction status or broadcast new transactions.
- **Validators, Mempool, and Health Endpoints:** Monitor network performance and validator status.

By leveraging these endpoints, you can build advanced monitoring, analysis tools, or custom transaction workflows that interact directly with the blockchain network.

Happy coding on the CoinFi blockchain!
