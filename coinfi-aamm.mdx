## A Simple, Smart Trading Experience

Our platform makes trading effortless by guiding you through every step:

1. **Easy Order Entry**  
   Choose the tokens you want to trade and simply enter the amount. Our clear, step‑by‑step process helps prevent errors.

2. **Lightning-Fast 5‑Second Rounds**  
   Orders are processed every 5 seconds, so you quickly get the best available market price.

3. **Intelligent Order Matching**  
   If your order isn't completely filled, the remainder is automatically queued for a better match—all while keeping costs low.

4. **Instant Confirmation**  
   As soon as your order is matched, it's immediately recorded on the blockchain, giving you real-time peace of mind.

---

## How It Works

We use proven, straightforward math to keep trades fair and efficient:

### Maintaining Balance with a Classic Formula

Our order matching is based on a constant-product model:

$$
x \times y = k
$$

- **\(x\)** and **\(y\):** Token amounts in the liquidity pool  
- **\(k\):** A fixed constant that keeps the pool balanced

### Managing Unfilled Orders

When part of your order isn't matched immediately, we re‑attempt matching in future rounds. If the order remains unmatched after several rounds, it's bridged using:

$$
\alpha_{\text{bridge}} = (1 - \eta)\,\bigl(1 - \eta_e\bigr)^\nu
$$

- **\(\eta\):** Efficiency of a direct match  
- **\(\eta_e\):** Efficiency during additional matching rounds  
- **\(\nu\):** Number of extra rounds before bridging is forced

This approach, as detailed in the **Quantum One-Time Atomic Swap Contracts** paper, can reduce bridging fees by up to 95% compared to legacy methods.

## Technology at a Glance

Our platform is built on solid technology that's both powerful and easy to understand:
